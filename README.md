# Green Stock Analysis



## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to find out stocks that are profitable for Steve to invest in. He wants an analysis that can run fast with thousand of stocks instead of the dozen stocks.

The analysis is also to refactor the code and make it run faster when a lot of stocks are analyzed or when there is a whole lot of data.



## Results

From refactoring the code, the runtime of the program reduced significantly. The runtime is as follows:

* It took approximately 0.38 second for the runtime of the 2017 worksheet and the image below shows the runtime.

* It took approximately 0.36 second for the runtime of the 2018 worksheet and the image below shows the runtime.

## Summary
Refactoring has some very good benefits and can also have some demerits and some of them are below.
### Advantages of Refactoring Code
* It helps make the runtime of codes faster 
* It Makes code cleaner and more organized
* It helps in code maintenance
* You can find bugs when you refactor

### Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
* It is easy to make mistakes when it is a large application
* There is a risk of not understanding what the code is all about due to less or incoherent comments.


From the refactoring of the code, the use of arrays for the storing the outputs significantly reduced the code runtime. Also because the code was not large and it was well commented on, refactoring the code did was not tedious.
